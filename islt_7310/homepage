<p>Welcome! I designed this site to inform you about my credentials and experience.</p>
<p>This site is intended to give you a more in-depth view of my experience, credentials, goals, and reflections than a typical resume would. In addition, I am using this site as a showcase of my work as I created it myself. Youâ€™ll find examples of my previous work, volunteering, areas of interest, personal reflections, and goals.</p>
