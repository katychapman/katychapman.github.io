<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Kaitlin Chapman, you can see me in the above image with my dog, Marcello. I attended the University of Nebraska - Lincoln and received my Bachelor’s degree in English in 2018. Currently, I’m completing my last semester at the University of Missouri. I will receive my Master’s in Library and Information Science at the end of December 2020. I previously worked as an Information and Technology Librarian. In that position, I gathered data and provided library statistics, such as materials checked out and new library cards. Additionally, I supervised the maker space. I taught patrons and staff to use the library’s 3D printer, laser cutter, vinyl cutter, button maker, and heat press. All areas of data from collection to analysis interest me. I hope this website informs you of my credentials and areas of interest.<br/>Please feel free to reach out with inquires.</p>
