<h1> Reflection</h1>
<h3>2021</h3>
<p>My goal for the upcoming year is to continue personal development in the pursuit of knowledge. I plan on learning more coding and database languages, particularly in areas of data collection and analysis. </p>
<h3>2020</h3>
<p>My goal for this year is to complete my Master’s in Library and information science. I am on track to do so in December.  In this role I was able to do things that I did not expect of myself, like teaching people how to use a laser cutter. However, I felt that my personal values did not align with the workplace. </p>
<h3>2019</h3>
<p>At the end of 2018 I was hired as the Technology and Information Librarian at the Beatrice Public Library, so I was beginning to understand the job more fully at 2019. I had a lot of practical learning this year. I learned SQL for library statistics. I had my first experience as a supervisor. I spoke publicly often, taught makerspace equipment, asked for grant money, and gave grant updates. I also continued working towards my graduate degree.</p>
<h3>2018</h3>
<p>In 2018 I had the goal of graduating with my BA in English, which I completed in August. As I was approaching the end of my bachelor’s I knew that I wanted to continue to expand my field of knowledge and pursue another degree. I wanted to pursue a field that I could get behind ethically. Librarianship was inline with many of my values, particularly the pursuit of knowledge and the idea of allowing others to access information with pay barriers and regardless of social class, gender, race, or sexual identity. I looked up the “Library Bill of Rights” and applied to the University of Missouri for the Library and Information program. I started 1 week after I completed my undergraduate. I also began volunteering at the African Poetry Library because I believed in their mission and I wanted to ensure that I was going into the right field, which I wholeheartedly was.
