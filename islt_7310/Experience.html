 <h1>Experience</h1>  
<p>I worked as the Technology and Information Library at the Beatrice Public Library from November 2018 to April 2020. In this position, I ran and compiled monthly statistics using SQL for use in monthly/annual reports and grant requests. I spearheaded the Maker Space project which included supervising, training staff, and patrons on the equipment (such as 3D printer, laser cutter, vinyl cutter, embroidery machine, and button maker). I answered reference questions with a focus on technology.</p>
<p>From August 2018 to July 2019 I volunteered at the African Poetry Library. I reached out directly to publishers and literary magazines for donations to be sent to 5 African countries (Botswana, Uganda, Kenya, The Gambia, Ghana). Using excel I tracked donation requests, donations received, thank-yous sent, and organized were each donation would be sent. I input metadata for each donation for the libraries to use once received. </p> 
<p>I interned at the literary magazine The Prarie Schooner from January 2018 to May 2018. I collaborated with other interns to organize and read submissions for inclusion in the magazine. Additionally, I organized via excel incoming books for review in the magazine.</p>
