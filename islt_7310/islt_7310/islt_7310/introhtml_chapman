     Hello classmates! My name is Kaitlin Chapman. I’m graduating with my Masters in Library and Information Science this December, which still doesn’t feel quite real. I’ve previously worked as Technology and Information Librarian, volunteered for African Poetry Libraries, and interned at the literary magazine “Prairie Schooner.” I co-founded and organized Lincoln Bi Night, which is a local meet up for bisexuals (temporarily on hold, given the pandemic). I have no web development training, so I am super stoked to learn in this 8-week class. My expectations are to be able to get a good grasp of HTML5 and CSS3. I hope to learn how to build a website for various needs in the future, from personal to professional. I bounce around hobbies a lot, but my latest is roller skating. I’m hoping to get stable enough to try out for roller derby once the pandemic is over, but the more immediate goal is stopping without help from a wall or floor. I also love reading, kayaking, cooking new vegetarian recipes, and hanging out with my cat (Carrot) and dog (Marcello).
