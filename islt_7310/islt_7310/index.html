<h1>Welcome!</h1> <h2>I designed this site to inform you about my credentials and experience.</h2>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website! This site is intended to give you a more in-depth view of my experience, credentials, goals, and reflections than a typical resume would. In addition, I am using this site as a showcase of my work as I created it myself. You’ll find examples of my previous work, volunteering, areas of interest, personal reflections, and goals. I also outline what I am looking for in a job that would suit me. If you think I would be a good fit in an open job or have any inquires please feel free to contact me. I look forward to getting in touch with you!</p>
